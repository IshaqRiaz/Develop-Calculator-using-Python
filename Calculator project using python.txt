Explanation of Your Calculator Project

Your project is a Python-based calculator that allows a user to perform four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Here’s what it does step by step:

 1.Welcome Message – Displays a greeting to the user.

 2.Looping Mechanism – Runs continuously until the user decides to quit.

 3.User Input – Takes two numbers as input (or q to quit).

 4.Operation Selection – Asks the user which operation (+, -, *, /) they want to perform.

 5.Execution – Performs the chosen calculation:

	Addition (+)

	Subtraction (-)

	Multiplication (*)

	Division (/) with a special check to avoid division by zero.

 6.Error Handling – Displays an error message if the user inputs something invalid.

 7.Exit Option – The user can press q anytime to quit the program.

 8.Thank You Message – Prints a goodbye note at the end.

This project demonstrates your ability to use loops, conditionals, input handling, type conversion, and error checking in Python.
